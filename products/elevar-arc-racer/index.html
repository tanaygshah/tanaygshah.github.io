      },
      {
        "question": "What's special about RYDEFOAM® technology?",
        "answer": "RYDEFOAM® is made from a special material called eTPU. It gives you better bounce, lasts longer, and feels more responsive than regular EVA foam in most shoes. It works well in different temperatures and stays comfortable for a long time.",
        "category": "technical"
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the AEROKNIT® material keep feet cool?",
        "answer": "AEROKNIT® is a special 3D knitted material with tiny holes that let air flow in and out. This keeps your feet from getting too sweaty and gives you a comfortable, sock-like fit.",
        "category": "technical"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is heel drop and why is it important?",
        "answer": "The heel of the ARC Racer is 10mm higher than the toe. This helps you run and walk more naturally, whether you land on your heel or the middle of your foot. It also provides good cushioning.",
        "category": "technical"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I clean my ARC Racer shoes?",
        "answer": "Use a soft brush to get rid of any dirt. Clean them with a damp cloth and some mild soap. Let them dry naturally away from sunlight. Don't machine wash them. Keep them in a place with good air flow.",

      },
      {
        "question": "What size should I get?",
        "answer": "We use UK sizing. The top part of the shoe gives a sock-like fit, so your usual UK size should be perfect. You can also adjust the fit with the double loop laces.",
        "category": "sizing"
      },
      {
        "question": "Are these shoes good for the gym?",
        "answer": "Yes, definitely! The 360° support system and side stabilizers make these shoes great for gym workouts, including side-to-side movements, lifting weights, and cardio.",
        "category": "usage"

      {
        "question": "How long will these shoes last?",
        "answer": "If you use them regularly (3-4 times a week), they should last for about 6-8 months. The eTPU RYDEFOAM® technology maintains cushioning properties longer than traditional foam materials.",
